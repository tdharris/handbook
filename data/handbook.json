This process gives the customer a seamless interface in solving complex multi-vendor problems among two or more vendors.  TSANet allows the assigned engineer to work directly with an engineer from another vendor to solve support issues. Think of it as a behind-the-scenes mechanism that expedites resolution, often without the customer even being aware of it being engaged. TSANet is a direct vendor-to-vendor contact; however, customers should have appropriate support entitlement with both vendors prior to the interaction. TSANet allows its members to work on your behalf and not waste time duplicating support incidents with multiple vendors.

This process gives the customer a seamless interface in solving complex multi-vendor problems among two or more vendors.  TSANet allows the assigned engineer to work directly with an engineer from another vendor to solve support issues. Think of it as a behind-the-scenes mechanism that expedites resolution, often without the customer even being aware of it being engaged. TSANet is a direct vendor-to-vendor contact; however, customers should have appropriate support entitlement with both vendors prior to the interaction. TSANet allows its members to work on your behalf and not waste time duplicating support incidents with multiple vendors.

We define a critical situation as “…one or more support Incidents whose timely resolution will minimize or prevent a major financial loss to one of our customers . “A critical situation is the highest level of escalation, raising the Incident visibility to the executive levels within the company.</p> <p>When you have an issue involving our products that is creating a major, adverse impact to your business, we want to ensure that the proper resources are quickly involved so we can resolve the issue in a timely manner. We have internal escalation procedures that involve specialized and focused levels of technical and management personnel working together to speed resolution.</p> <p>There are several things you can do during a critical situation that will enable us to help you more effectively. Please follow these guidelines when reporting a critical situation:</p> <ul> <li>Please contact us as early as possible</li> <li>Have an authorized contact open the Incident by phone. Do not use email or the Customer Center to open a critical Incident</li> <li>At the beginning of your initial call, indicate the critical nature of the situation. If the issue did not start out as critical, but has since become such, notify us with a phone call. Information on the level of impact the particular critical situation is having on your business operations is extremely helpful. Be ready to provide us with all relevant information: contact ID, product versions, patch levels, configuration, troubleshooting steps performed, and so forth. (It may be helpful for you to call from the site where the critical situation is occurring.)</li> <li>If you have a SAM, notify him or her as soon as possible regarding the critical situation. This is a vital step in ensuring that the appropriate resources are ready to help you.</li> </ul> <p>Should an Incident become critical, authorized contacts should notify their support engineer, ASE, PSE, or DSE; and/or SAM to make them aware of the business impact. The support engineer will be able to coordinate all of the relevant technical resources needed to progress a problem to a resolution. Where additional escalation assistance is required, the SAM can help facilitate this process. Following this communication process will ensure that relevant resources from our company are engaged and that you are updated regularly on the resolution progress.</p> <p>After they are approved, critical situations are reviewed on a daily basis by the Technical Support team, which will initiate regular action plan updates from the Assigned Support Engineer (or SAM) to all appropriate management contacts within your organization until the critical situation is resolved.</p>"}}},"Resolving Multi-Vendor Issues":{"content":"<p>We are a founding sponsor and remain an active member of the Technical Support Alliance Network (TSANet)—a global, vendor-neutral, not-for-profit industry support alliance. This organization creates an industry infrastructure, allowing members to collaborate and work on multi-vendor customer issues without “finger pointing.” TSANet follows industry-standard support policies and obligates members to collaborate on issues to isolation or resolution (or both). This process gives the customer a seamless interface in solving complex multi-vendor problems among two or more vendors. </p> <p>TSANet allows the assigned engineer to work directly with an engineer from another vendor to solve support issues. Think of it as a behind-the-scenes mechanism that expedites resolution, often without the customer even being aware of it being engaged. TSANet is a direct vendor-to-vendor contact; however, customers should have appropriate support entitlement with both vendors prior to the interaction. TSANet allows its members to work on your behalf and not waste time duplicating support incidents with multiple vendors.
