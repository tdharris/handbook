As part of ongoing integration (see why this is necessary) designed to improve your online experience with us, it may be necessary for you to re-create your login account. You will fall into one of two categories:

Category 1: You have a login account with NetIQ's affiliate, Novell.
If you already have a login account with Novell, simply log in with this account now which will also then become your NetIQ login. It is critical that the email address on your Novell account matches the email address on your myNetIQ account. This will sync both accounts resulting in a single login for both Novell and NetIQ environments. If your emails don't match, please see our FAQ.

Category 2: You do not have a login account with NetIQ's affiliate, Novell.
In this case you will need to create a new login account. It is critical that you use the same email address from your myNetIQ account (your myNetIQ username) to create the new account. Once your new account is created, simply log in and your account will be synced.

The purpose of this single sign-on account is solely to allow easier access via a single-sign on to the Novell, SUSE and NetIQ sites.

The quality of the initial reporting will reflect the time it takes to achieve resolution.
A high quality Support Incident should have:
• An accurate – but short – description of the symptom
• A complete summary of the circumstances and context of the failure
• As much detail as possible – if in doubt, include it!
• Important details such as chronology, symptoms, configuration, workload levels and 3rd party software involved
• Where possible, step-by- step instructions of how to reproduce the error.
• Attach the source, application, log files (not screen shots of log files) and any applicable projects. If possible, zip them to minimize attachment size.
• Populate the User Sort field with any free-form value that helps you to sort your company’s incidents in a meaningful way – your internal issue tracking number, for example.
For further diagnostic information specifically related to the Micro Focus Enterprise product suite, please refer to the Troubleshooting and Diagnostic Guide (http://supportline.microfocus.com/000/MFTroubleShootingAndDiagnostics.pdf).
We strongly recommend managing any incidents via the SupportLine web portal to ensure any updates are delivered immediately to the Support Engineer managing the issue.

How to Escalate a Service Request,Critical Situation Handling Process,NV,,Yes,"In exception circumstances, where a mission critical component is down, causing a major business impact, we can declare a critical situation. We define a critical situation as “…one or more support Service Requests whose timely resolution will minimize or prevent a major financial loss to one of our customers . “A critical situation is the highest level of escalation, raising the service request visibility to the executive levels within the company.

When you have an issue involving our products that is creating a major, adverse impact to your business, we want to ensure that the proper resources are quickly involved so we can resolve the issue in a timely manner. We have internal escalation procedures that involve specialized and focused levels of technical and management personnel working together to speed resolution.

There are several things you can do during a critical situation that will enable us to help you more effectively. 
Please follow these guidelines when reporting a critical situation:
- Please contact us as early as possible
- Have an authorized contact open the service request by phone. Do not use email or the Customer Center to open a critical service request
- At the beginning of your initial call, indicate the critical nature of the situation. If the issue did not start out as critical, but has since become such, notify us with a phone call. Information on the level of impact the particular critical situation is having on your business operations is extremely helpful. Be ready to provide us with all relevant information: contact ID, product versions, patch levels, configuration, troubleshooting steps performed, and so forth. (It may be helpful for you to call from the site where the critical situation is occurring.)
- If you have a SAM, notify him or her as soon as possible regarding the critical situation. This is a vital step in ensuring that the appropriate resources are ready to help you.

Should a service request become critical, authorized contacts should notify their support engineer, ASE, PSE, or DSE; and/or SAM to make them aware of the business impact. The support engineer will be able to coordinate all of the relevant technical resources needed to progress a problem to a resolution. Where additional escalation assistance is required, the SAM can help facilitate this process. Following this communication process will ensure that relevant resources from our company are engaged and that you are updated regularly on the resolution progress.

After they are approved, critical situations are reviewed on a daily basis by the Technical Support team, which will initiate regular action plan updates from the assigned support engineer (or SAM) to all appropriate management contacts within your organization until the critical situation is resolved.",,Linked to Winfreid,

When you report a software defect using our free bug tool, you will not receive a call back from a support engineer, as this tool is not an avenue for technical support.

If you choose to report the bug by opening a service request, you will be able to talk to a support engineer, and if the issue is corrected, you could receive a program temporary fix (PTF). Although most customers are entitled to unlimited support, if you are a partner or academic institution with limited service requests, a service request will be decremented from your count if your support agreement has a limit on service requests. You may request us to credit the service request if the problem is determined to be a software defect for which information has not previously published as a Technical Information Document (TID) in the Support Knowledgebase, or documented in our release notes or maintenance notifications.

For this purpose of this document, a software defect is either:
- During the General Support phase of the product support lifecycle, an error in a product’s functionality that results in the software’s failure to perform substantially in accordance with its specifications and for which our company is responsible; or

- Beta
- Current - General Availability (GA)
- Supported - Continued Support
- Withdrawn - Sunset

Beta
During a product beta, NetIQ may provide support during normal working hours for the product - see your sales representative for additional details. Beta code is only available to customers with current maintenance and is provided on an ""as-is"" basis.

Current
For all products in this phase of the lifecycle, NetIQ will provide support and maintenance offerings, which will allow you to choose the most appropriate level of support for your organization. Maintenance offerings may consist of maintenance releases, service packs and/or hotfixes. Hotfixes and service packs are not available for all products. Support services include, but are not limited to Knowledgebase, online support, and phone support during business hours; 24x7 support is available to customers who have purchased Priority maintenance.

Supported
Once a product version enters the Supported lifecycle phase, NetIQ will no longer actively develop new fixes or service packs for that version. Technical support reserves the right to request that the customer upgrade to the current version.

NetIQ may offer limited support on that version for an additional 12 months answering usage questions only. Providing technical support during this period does not imply that NetIQ will fix software defects or make changes to the software.

Withdrawn
When a product version enters the Withdrawn lifecycle phase, NetIQ will no longer provide support for that product version. Knowledgebase articles will remain available for a period beyond this withdrawal date.
